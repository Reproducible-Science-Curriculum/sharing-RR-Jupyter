This lesson covers how to share your work with others. It focuses on
setting up a GitHub account and putting your code on a public repository,
as well as adding dependency files to your repository so that you can
share links to an interactive version of your code using Binder.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson requires access to the internet and the ability to create a GitHub account.
>
> It also uses the notebook created in an earlier lesson, but there are sample notebooks that could be downloaded and used instead.
