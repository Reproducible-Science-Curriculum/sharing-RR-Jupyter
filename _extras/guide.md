## Introduction to Binder

Note that there's a problem with launching the Python Data Science Handbook repo on Mybinder, due to an incompatibility between the required version of the scikit-image dependency and the default Python runtime on Mybinder.

This has been temporarily fixed in [#8](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/sharing-RR-Jupyter/pull/8). If learners notice the inconstistency between the Github URL and the Mybinder.org URL, you can explain this.
